# Hi and thanks for using the PolyPop websocket plugin!

<i>
  I created this for people to be able to use external bot's and apps with PolyPop.
</i><br>
This plugin is unlike OBS's Websocket plugin, in that, it doesn't have a rigid set of rules to follow.<br>
<u>
  You as the broadcaster set up exactly what you want PolyPop to respond to
</u>
, and exactly what you want it to send out.<br>
<b>
  There are no rules! ðŸ˜Ž
</b>
and I personally think that this allows for the most freedom and ease of use, as well as a (marginally) less bloated plugin!

# How do I use it?
